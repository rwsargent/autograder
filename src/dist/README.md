# Configuration

The configuration of the app evolved over time. Anytime I needed something configurable, I'd plop it into configuration.json. I hope to pull apart some of the configuration into separate files before a final release. In the meantime, everything configurable should be placed in "configuration.json" at the top level of the app.
